## Test Compiler: Statement of Work

## The Purpose

Our client, Matthew Pogue of WSU Tech, in Wichita, KS, is requesting assistance in building a simple GUI application to help efficiently hand out tests to students. The purpose of this is to automate the process of structuring a test, and let the students have the ability to quickly access it.

## Scope of Work 

All code will be appeneded to this GitHub project (/<https://github.com/colelong101/PythonFinal>), in the form of a pull request from a seperate branch. Anything that needs to be added, such as source code, additional documents, and any documentation will be transferred here. If there are any roadblocks in the development process that will cause significant change or restrcuturing, and extension will be discussed with the client.

## Deliverables

A well structured GUI application that is modern and smooth, while still providing all needed information.
-A module that contains a parser for the test questions and answers, and sends the data to another module, that displays them for the user, with multiple choice format
-A class for testQuestion, and testAnswer that each hold specific attributes that distinguish the differences betwwen them. 
-Each testQuestion, will need to have a correct testAnswer, and to do this, there will be an speical attribute assigned to the correct testAnswer, that when true, or false, displays accordingly when the test is submitted.
-A testSubmit class that checks all of the testAnswers selected, and cycles through else if statements to determine whether the answer is correct, and displays a score.

## Timeline

Updates will be 3 times every week, once on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The timeline of events is planned as listed:
-**Monday Feb 27th**: Familiarize yourself with the chosen language of the the developers to execute the project, and begin mockups for the GUI.
-**Monday Mar 6th**: Research on language is done, and a comprehensive design framework has been written up, presented, and approved to begin production.
-**Monday Mar 13th**: The code has been written according to the style guide, and the debugging begins.
-**Monday Mar 20th**: Implementation is finished, and the code is ready to be submitted to the Repository.

## Compensation

The compensation for the completion of this project will be provided in the form of 2 payments, delivered in the first week upon completing the project. The first payment will be $1,000,000 in the form of DogeCoin, and the second payment will be delivered via company email, in the form of a Starbucks gift card, and some Old Spice deodorant.
